## Description
My scene consists of An Island with a small settlement on top of it. Some trees and some tents. 

## Scene Location
The default scene in the Projects is where the Terrain and view are located. 

## Asset Source
I used the Unity Asset Store to source for assets since it was much more comfortable and had what I was looking for.
