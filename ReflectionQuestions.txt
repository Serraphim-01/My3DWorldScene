How did you design your UI Pages to make navigation Intuitive?
I designed my UI pages with clear labels, consistent layout, and easily accessible buttons placed in expected positions, 
using visual hierarchy to guide the user’s attention and make navigation intuitive and seamless

What challenges did you encounter while integrating audio?
One challenge I encountered while integrating audio was managing multiple AudioSources to prevent overlapping
I also encountered abrupt cuts between background music, especially when transitioning between UI and gameplay.

How did you ensure a seamless transition between your UI and your 3D world scene?
- I ensured a seamless transition between the UI and the 3D world scene by switching out the UI canvas while simultaneously starting the 3D scene’s camera and background audio.

What Improvements would you make given more time?
- I would love to work more on the UI design as it is currently too plain.
