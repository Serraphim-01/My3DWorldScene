How did you design the UI animations to enhance User Experience?
- I designed the UI animations to enhance user experience by adding Fade In and 
Slide In from the Left transitions to the Start and Quit buttons for a smooth entrance, 
applying a looping float animation to the Instructions and Credits buttons to draw gentle 
attention, and using Slide In animations for the Start Menu, Instructions Page, and 
Credits Page to make transitions feel dynamic and intuitive.


What challenges did you face while animating the 3D object and setting up transitions?
- One challenge I faced was syncing the animations with player input while making sure 
transitions like crouching and walking looked smooth and responsive without scripting 
everything manually.

How did you ensure compatibility for both PC and Mobile platforms?
- I ensured compatibility for both PC and Mobile by using Unity's Input System to support 
keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen controls, and by designing UI and gameplay elements to 
adapt seamlessly across screen types and input methods.

What Improvements would you make if given more time?
- If given more time, I would improve the player animations with smoother blend 
transitions, add jump and sprint mechanics, polish the UI with more fluid motion and 
sound feedback, and enhance mobile controls with customizable sensitivity and gesture 
zones.
